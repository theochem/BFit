Welcome to BFit's documentation!
================================

`BFit <https://github.com/theochem/bfit>`_ is a free, open-source, and cross-platform
Python library for fitting a convex sum of Gaussian functions of s-type and p-type to any
probability distribution.

BFIt is released under the
`GNU General Public License v3.0 <https://github.com/theochem/procrustes/blob/master/LICENSE>`_.
Please report any issues you encounter while using BFit library on
`GitHub Issues <https://github.com/theochem/bfit/issues>`_.

Models
------
BFit supports fitting any probability distribution to a linear combination of Gaussian functions of the form:

.. math::
   \sum_i c_i e^{-\alpha_i ||\vec{r} - \vec{v}||^2} + \sum_j d_j ||\vec{r} - \vec{c}||^2 e^{-\beta_j ||\vec{r} - \vec{c}||^2}

where :math:`\vec{c}` is the center of the Gaussian.

The first type of Gaussian function :math:`e^{-\alpha_i ||\vec{r} - \vec{v}||^2}` are referred to as s-type Gaussians
and the second type of Gaussian function :math:`||\vec{r} - \vec{c}||^2 e^{-\beta_j ||\vec{r} - \vec{c}||^2}` are referred to
as p-type Gaussian functions.

In addition, it supports mixture of Gaussians placed on different centers.

Objective Functions
-------------------
BFit supports the minimization of least-squares formula for fitting a model :math:`g(x)`
to a probability density :math:`f(x)`,

.. math::
   \int (f(x) - g(x))^2 dx,

and minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence formula,

.. math::
   \int f(x) \log \bigg( \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \bigg) dx.
