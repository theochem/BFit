r"""
Contains utility functions that are used by any greedy-fitting algorithms.

As of know, most of these functions rely on the basis function to depend on
only one parameters. E.g. e^(-x) or e^(-x^2) but not e^(-x - y).

def check_redundancies(coeffs, fparams, simi=1e-3):
    r"""
    Check if the fparams have similar values and groups them together.

    If any two function parameters have similar values, then one of the
    function parameters is removed, and the corresponding coefficient,
    is doubled.
    Note: as of now this only works if each basis function depends on only one
    parameters e.g. e^(-x), not e^(-x + y).

    Parameters
    ----------
    coeffs : np.ndarray
             Coefficients of the basis function set.

    fparams : np.ndarray
              Function Parameters of the basis function set.

    simi : float
           Value that indicates the treshold for how close two parameters are.

    Returns
    -------
    (np.ndarray, np.ndarray)
                            New coefficients and new exponents, where close
                            values are grouped together.

def get_next_choices(factor, coeffs, fparams, coeff_val=100.):
    r"""
    Get the next set of (n+1) fparams, used by the greedy-fitting algorithm.

    Given a set of n fparams and n coeffs, this method gets the next (n+1)
    fparams by using the factor.
    A list of (n+1) choices are returned. They are determined as follows,
    if fparams = [a1, a2, ..., an] and coeffs = [c1, c2, ..., cn].
    Then each choice is either
                [a1 / factor, a2, a3, .., an] & coeffs = [c1, c1, c2, ..., cn],
                [a1, a2, ..., (ai + a(i+1)/2, a(i+1), ..., an] & similar coeffs,
                [a1, a2, ..., factor * an] & coeffs = [c1 c2, ..., cn, cn].

    Parameters
    ----------
    factor : float
             Number used to give two choices by multiplying each end point.
    coeffs : np.ndarray
             Coefficients of the basis functions.
    fparams : np.ndarray
              Function parameters.
    coeff_val : float
                Number used to fill in the coefficient value for each guess.
