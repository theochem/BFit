            evaluated on.
        deriv : bool, optional
            Whether it should return the derivatives of the  measure w.r.t. to the
            model parameters.

        Returns
        -------
        m : ndarray(N,)

    def evaluate(self, density, model, deriv=False):

        Evaluate squared difference b/w density & model on the grid points.

        This is defined to be :math:`(f(x) - g(x))^2`,

            :math:`f` is the true function, and

        deriv : bool, optional
            Whether to compute the derivative of squared difference w.r.t. model density.

        Returns
        -------
        m : ndarray(N,)
            The squared difference between density & model on the grid points.

        Notes

        mask_value : float, optional
            The elements less than or equal to this number are masked in a division,
